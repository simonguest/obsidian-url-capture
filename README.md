# Obsidian URL Capture Chrome Extension

When doing research, I wanted an easy way to capture the current URL for further reading and/or filing in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) workflow. This simple extension does exactly that.

## Prerequisites

- This Chrome extension requires the [**Advanced URI**](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) Community Plug-in to be installed and active in Obsidian.


## Installing the extension

- Clone this repo to a local folder
- Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode (if it isn't already)
- Click on the **Load unpacked** button and open the local folder with the extension files
- Click on the **Keyboard shortcuts** menu item and ensure that the keyboard shortcut is set correctly. It should default to CTRL-SHIFT-O, but you can override in this screen.

## Setting the Vault Name

- When the Chrome Extension has been installed, click on the extension icon (a paperclip) in the extension menu. Enter the name of your default vault and click the save button.

## Using the Extension

- Browse to a page in Chrome and use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+O or whatever you've manually configured). 
- You'll be prompted to open Obsidian. You can click on **Always open Obsidian** to surpress this in the future.
- The URL, title, and date captured will now be appended to your daily note.
